Zend Quickstart Tutorial
========================

This project is just the application described at this url:
http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/learning.quickstart.intro.html

Database Server
===============

I first setup the project with sqlite, per the tutorial.
Now I've changed the application to use mysql.

Necessary Changes
=================

The data files are no longer located in quickstart/data/db.
This change was configured in the application.ini file.

Differences between sqlite and mysql
====================================

It is my understanding that each mysql server instance has one datadir.
So it wouldn't make sense to put the application data in quickstart/data/db.

SQL syntax
==========

I had to make some changes to quickstart/scripts/schema.sqlite.sql.

Changes to load.sqlite.sql
==========================

I left the file name unchanged even though I'm now using mysql.
Lines in the file load.sqlite.sql which refer to a dbfile or act on the db file are
no longer needed and have been removed.
